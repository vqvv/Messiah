        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="bordered-box">Thank you for reading our privacy policy page. We assure our clients that their personal data and information will be completely secure in our databases. Please read further for elaboration on the information we collect.</p>
        
        <h3>1. Data we collect</h3>
        <p>Messiah's website does not collect any personal information or data. Messiah Bot collects data such as Server ID, User ID, Channel ID, etc.</p>
        
        <h5>- Why are we collecting such information?</h5>
        <p class="indented">We collect such information to provide unique responses to different clients. Some features work differently for every guild, thus requiring us to collect unique identifiers such as the ID of the server where the feature was enabled.</p>
        
        <h5>- How do we protect our client's data?</h5>
        <p class="indented">We ensure that our client's data is safe and secure in our servers. We have taken measures to prevent data loss and overall protection of the database is taken care of. We will never misuse or share your data.</p>
        
        <h5>- How can you get your data wiped from our database?</h5>
        <p class="indented">You may request a data wipe in our support server tickets. Once done, we cannot revert the process or regain the database which has been lost.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Global Chat Policy</h3>
        <p>Messiah's global chat feature, once enabled in a server, will collect data such as Server ID, Server name, User ID, Username, Channel ID, message content, Channel Webhook URL, etc.</p>
        
        <h5>- Why are we collecting such information for global chat?</h5>
        <p class="indented">We collect such information to assist the functioning of global chat. Without it, global chat's current functioning would not be possible.</p>
        
        <h5>- How can you get your data wiped from our database?</h5>
        <p class="indented">You may run the global chat disable command. It will delete all data related to the global chat that was set up in your server.</p>
        
        <h5>- Further Details</h5>
        <p class="indented">Global chat requires additional privacy to maintain a healthy environment. We, the Messiah Team, have certain rights to control the global chat, which are mentioned in the terms of service. Please read them for further details.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Auto-Moderation</h3>
        <p>Messiah's auto-moderation, if enabled, will monitor the messages sent in your server and delete messages accordingly.</p>
        
        <h5>- How can you opt out from being Auto-Moderated?</h5>
        <p class="indented">You cannot opt out of auto-moderation if it is enabled by the server admins.</p>
        
        <h5>- What if you wish to prevent auto-moderation from working in certain channels?</h5>
        <p class="indented">You may whitelist channels where you do not want auto-moderation to work. Messages from whitelisted channels will not be monitored.</p>
        
        <h5>- Further details</h5>
        <p class="indented">Messiah will not store or redistribute any messages sent in any server. Messages flagged by auto-moderation will be deleted as per the purpose of auto-moderation.</p>
